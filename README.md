# mrcs-auth

## Introduction

This module is a simple JWT-based authentication and authorization
server.

It does not handle user creation, which has to be done separately.
The [mrcs-user-management](https://github.com/marcosbc/mrcs-user-management)
server was created for that purpose in this example.

### Example

Once your server is started, in order to perform the auth, it is enough
to access your server via your browser or with cURL:

```
curl -u myuser http://localhost:3000/auth
```

### Liveness and readiness

This server implements a liveness and readiness page, accessible at
`/liveness` and `/readiness` respectively:

- `/liveness` will always show a simple `{"hello":"world"}` response,
  used to checking whether the microservice is running or not (if it is
  not, the page would not be accessible).
- `/readiness` will show a simple `{"ready":STATUS}` response, where
  STATUS is either `true` or `false`, depending on whether the database
  was initialized or not.

### What is JWT?

JWT stands for JSON Web Tokens. You can read more about them
[here](https://jwt.io).
